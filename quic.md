# QUIC

[QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic) is a multiplexed stream transport over
UDP.  It advertises the following benefits over TCP:

- Dramatically reduced connection establishment time
- Improved congestion control
- Multiplexing without head of line blocking
- Forward error correction
- Connection migration

# Presentation API functionality

QUIC is designed to be a transport for HTTP/2, so Presentation API functions
could be implemented in terms of HTTP/2.  If instead, the Presentation API is
implemented directly on top of QUIC, here is a high level outline of how it
could work.

A QUIC connection between client and server transmits data in
[QUIC Streams](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-00#section-6.1).
Each Stream represents a bidrectional reliable sequence of data packets, can
originate from the server or client, and has a unique integer ID.

Assume that a single QUIC connection is used to transmit data between the
controlling user agent and receiver.  The following mapping could be used to
associate streams with Presentation API concepts:

- One reserved stream with ID 5 for control messages between the controlling
  user agent and receiver.
- One stream with ID >= 10 for each PresentationConnection.

Within each stream, an Open Screen specific framing would have to be defined to
allow individual messages to be extracted, similar to how
[HTTP/2 resources](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-00)
are mapped to Streams.

*TODO:* If WebSockets are possible on QUIC, investigate how it is done.

With this outline, once connection was established, the requirements could be
met as follows:

## Presentation Initiation

1. Send a control message on Stream 5 from the controlling user agent to the
   reciever to start the presentation with ID, URL, and a Stream ID for the
   initial presentation connection.
2. Get a reply on Stream 5 with the ID, URL, and stream ID to confirm success
   (or report an error).

## Presentation Resumption

1. Send a control message on Stream 5 from the controlling user agent to the
   receiver reconnect to a presentation with ID, URL, and a Stream ID for the
   initial presentation connection.
2. Get a reply on Stream 5 with the ID, URL, and stream ID to confirm success
   (or report an error).

## Presentation Connections

Multiple connections from a controlling user agent can be handled by assigning
unique Stream IDs, and the receiver can use stream IDs to disambiguate the
sources of incoming messages.

Either side may close the stream it uses to send messages to the destination
browsing context by setting the
[FIN flag](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-00#section-8.1)
in the final QUIC frame on the stream. It can also send a message on Stream 5
indicating the reason why the connection was closed.

## Presentation Connection Messaging

Binary or text messages can be sent on the QUIC Stream corresponding to the
presentation connection.  The framing of these messages would need to be
defined.

## Presentation Termination

A controlling user agent can send a control message with URL and ID on Stream 5
to instruct a receiver to terminate a presentation.

The receiver can send a
[RST_STREAM](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-00#section-6.6)
frame with a custom error code to inform all presentation connections that a
presentation is about to be terminated.

# Remote Playback API functionality

TBD once remote playback API requirements are set.

# Reliability

*TODO:* Get reliability data.

# Latency to establish a new connection

QUIC is designed to minimize the number of round trips needed to establish or
re-establish connections.

*TODO:* Get connection latency data.

# Latency to transmit messages

QUIC allows for out of order packet delivery, which may improve the latency to
deliver presentation connection messages on a congested or lossy network.

*TODO:* Get supporting data.

# Ease of implementation / deployment

*TODO*: Research

# Privacy

By relying on UDP, the IP addresses of both endpoints are visible to network
observers.  The plaintext portions of the authentication handshake are also
visible to observers.

Once authentication is established, the current [QUIC
crypto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g5nIXAIkN_Y-7XJW5K45IblHd_L2f5LTaDUDwvZ5L6g/edit)
implementation encrypts full datagrams including all QUIC stream framing
information.

# IPv4 and IPv6 support

QUIC depends only on UDP, which is supported for both IPv4 and IPv6.

# Guest Mode support

QUIC requires the ability route IP packets between both endpoints.  If both
IP:port combinations are already exposed on the WAN, then no additional changes
are required once those addresses are known.

However, in the common case, the endpoints will be behind a firewall or NAT and
a traversal solution is required.  Two possible solutions to this include:

* The use of [STUN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389) to create a publicly
  accessible IP:port for each endpoint and facilitate their secure exchange.
* The use of a cloud proxy to reflect QUIC packets between a pair of
  publicly-accessible IP:ports.

Either solution requires an additional cloud service to coordinate the exchange
of publicly accessible IP:port pairs and possibly act as a data proxy.

In some cases restrictive firewalls prevent the distribution of UDP traffic
outside of the LAN, which will render this transport inoperative.

While feasible, additional APIs and specifications would be required to define
how the controlling user agent and presentation display provision and gain
access to the necessary cloud services.

# Hardware requirements

*TODO*: Obtain data on hardware requirements

# Network and power efficiency

*TODO*: Obtain data on network and power efficiency

# Standardization status

QUIC has a standards track specification in the
IETF [QUIC Working Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/charter/).  Last
call is expected in late 2018.

*TODO:* Link appropriate IPR policy and any relevant disclosures.

# Security

QUIC does not mandate a specific security mechanism to authenticate and encrypt
the transport.  Stream 1 is reserved for authentication handshake and
implementations can plug in their own crypto protocol using this stream.

The current
[QUIC crypto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g5nIXAIkN_Y-7XJW5K45IblHd_L2f5LTaDUDwvZ5L6g/edit)
was based on an earlier version of TLS 1.3.  It's expected to be replaced with a
[newer version](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-tls-00).

*TODO* Check status.

# User Experience

QUIC allows human readable error messages to be sent with a
[CONNECTION_CLOSE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-00#section-6.9)
frame.  This could be used to surface information via the Presentation API or
the user agent when a presentation connection is closed in an error state.
