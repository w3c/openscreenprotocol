# Transport name

Describe tranport at a high level here.

# Design and specification

Add links to specifications and design docs.

# Presentation API functionality

Describe how the transport meets [functional requirements for the Presentation
API](../requirements.md#req-p2-initiation), especially requirements 2-6.

# Remote Playback API functionality

Describe how the transport meets functional requirements for the Remote Playback
API.

**TODO:** Fill in when Remote Playback equirements are known.
See [Issue #3](https://github.com/webscreens/openscreenprotocol/issues/3).

# Reliability

Data describing reliability in different network environments.

# Latency to establish a new connection

Data on connection establishment latency.

# Latency to transmit messages

Data on latency of message transmission.

# Network and power efficiency

Any data about power and network overhead.

# Ease of implementation / deployment

Including availability of open source implementations.

# IPv4 and IPv6 support

# Guest Mode support

Can this tranport be used to connect controlling user agents and presentation
displays outside of a local area network?  If so, what modifications would be
required, if any?

Note that detailed specifications for use of Open Screen outside the LAN are not
in scope; this is an assessment of feasibility.

# Hardware requirements

The minimum specifications needed to use the transport, and whether the devices
in [Sample Device Specifications](../device_specs.md) are sufficient.

# Standardization status

Describe standardization process, timeline, and link to working group's IPR
policy, if any.

# Privacy

What device or application information is exposed to network observers by the
transport?

# Security

Describe security architecture and what encryption and authentication mechanisms
are supported.

# User experience

Describe any specific impact on
meeting [user experience requirements](../requirements.md#req-nf3-ux) not covered
by the points above.
